.. _visualise-servo-behaviour:

Visualise the relationship between pulse-widths and angles
----------------------------------------------------------

A Jupter Notebook is included, to  help visualise the relationship between pulse-widths and angles, using the same ``numpy.polyfit()`` as used in the BrachioGraph:

   :alt: 'Pulse-widths to angles'
   :class: 'main-visual'

To run the Notebook::

    jupyter lab pulse_widths.ipynb
